Your task is to help generate smart contract code based on the user's requirements."""

# Prompt for analyzing requirements
ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are an expert AELF smart contract developer. Your task is to analyze the dApp description and provide a detailed analysis.

Analyze the requirements and identify:
- Contract name (provide a meaningful name for the contract based on its purpose)
- Contract type and purpose
- Core features and functionality
- Required methods and their specifications
- State variables and storage needs
- Events and their parameters
- Access control and security requirements

Your analysis MUST start with a section titled "Contract Name" that clearly states a single name for the contract (e.g., "Contract Name: TokenSwap").

Provide a structured analysis that will be used to generate the smart contract code in the next step.
Do not generate any code in this step, focus only on the analysis."""

        <!-- Example: -->
        <PackageReference Include="AElf.Sdk.CSharp" Version="1.5.0" />
        <!-- If using MultiToken, include: -->
        <PackageReference Include="AElf.Contracts.MultiToken" Version="1.5.0" />
        <!-- Include all other necessary packages -->
    </ItemGroup>
    <!-- Protobuf configuration -->

# Prompt for proto file generation
PROTO_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert AELF smart contract developer. Your task is to generate the content for an AELF-specific proto file.

Generate ONLY the content of the requested proto file. Do not include any explanations or markdown. The output should be valid proto syntax that can be directly saved to a file.

Proto file to generate: {proto_file_path}

For AELF proto files, follow these important guidelines:
1. Use the correct package name
2. Include proper csharp_namespace
3. Add comments explaining the purpose of each message, enum, or extension
4. Follow AELF's established structure and conventions for this file type

# Sample References:

Follow these rules:
1. IMPORTANT: You will be provided with template files that contain generic Hello World functionality. You MUST REPLACE this basic functionality with appropriate implementation for the required dApp.
2. Maintain the core structure of each template file - keep the namespaces, class declarations, and base interfaces, but replace the methods and state variables.
3. ADD methods, state variables, events, and other elements needed for the contract functionality based on the analysis.
4. Ensure all added code follows AELF best practices and coding standards.
5. When modifying a file, provide the COMPLETE file content with your enhancements integrated.
6. Format your response with clear file markers: ```File: path/to/file.cs``` followed by the code.
7. Be sure to implement all functionality described in the requirements.
8. When updating the .proto file, maintain its structure and add new messages, services, and methods as needed.
9. For the .csproj file, make sure to add any additional package references needed for the enhanced functionality.
10. If errors or fixes are mentioned from previous validation, prioritize addressing those issues.

Use this approach to transform the template:
- For each file, understand its current structure and purpose
- REPLACE the basic Read/Update methods with appropriate functionality for the specific dApp
- Add new methods, state variables, events based on the dApp requirements
- Preserve the namespace and class structure, but completely transform the implementation
- Ensure the file remains syntactically valid after your changes
- Update related files to maintain consistency

Your response should contain complete file contents for each file you modify.
